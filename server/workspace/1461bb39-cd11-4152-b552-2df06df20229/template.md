**The importance of your CV**

When applying to business school, you have to submit a CV. How much
effort will you put into this relative to your application essays? Think
about what other applicants might have on their CVs - think about how to
stand out from the crowd. Your CV is often your first opportunity to
sell yourself to the Admissions Committee!

A good CV:

- Highlights your achievements

- Identifies what you excel at

- Creates excitement and differentiates you from others

Before starting your CV, think about yourself as a person:

- Who you are

- What drives you

- Your personal achievements

And then think about:

- What you have done

- Which skills are relevant

- Your professional achievements

**Writing a CV using the LBS format**

If you are selected to join the Programme the LBS format CV is the CV
you will be using when you arrive on campus. All students use the same
format. This helps recruiters identify the students they want to meet
from the hundreds of applications they receive. In compiling one now you
will be ready to talk to prospective employers as soon as you arrive in
London!

The LBS format CV is designed to [highlight]{.underline} your
experience, your achievements and your skills in an easy to read layout.
Irrespective of how long you have been working, the information you
provide should not exceed one page and should be broken down into
EDUCATION / WORK EXPERIENCE / ADDITONAL INFORMATION.

Recruiters have very little time to look at CVs for their first cut,
sometimes no more than 6 seconds. Therefore, your CV must have immediate
impact, describing your attributes in as succinct a way as possible.

**Tips**

- Make sure you fill the whole page, but avoid using too much
  information.

- Company descriptions should be short and not exceed one line.

- Aim to have between 12 and 15 bullet points to describe your
  achievements.

- Ideally, bullet points should be one-and-a-half to two full lines long
  and one continuous sentence.

- Your bullet points should be achievement based backed by skills or
  competencies.

- Use impact verbs to start each bullet point -- examples include:
  accomplished, achieved, advised, analysed, assessed, coached,
  communicated, compiled, completed, convinced, created, defined,
  demonstrated, developed, enhanced, evaluated, executed, expanded,
  focused, generated, identified, implemented, improved, increased,
  initiated, invested, mentored; motivated, negotiated, organised,
  participated, performed, persuaded, planned, presented, produced,
  proposed, raised, recommended, recruited, represented, researched,
  revised, shaped, solved, succeeded, transformed, won!

- Try to demonstrate competencies that recruiters look for throughout
  your CV - examples include: accountability, analytical thinking,
  client focus, commercial acumen, commitment, communication,
  creativity, decisiveness, endurance, enthusiasm, entrepreneurship,
  independence, influence, initiative, innovation, leadership;
  modelling, motivation, negotiation, networking, people management,
  persuasion, project management, problem solving, quantitative ability,
  risk management, stakeholder management, strategic thinking, team
  working, transaction experience, valuation.

- Additional information should, where applicable, demonstrate that you
  are a rounded person with outside interests, mentorship and leadership
  skills (e.g. captaining a sports team), compassion (e.g. charitable
  work) as well as work-related information that is related to the role
  you are applying for (e.g. own portfolio, knowledge of Bloomberg,
  regular contributor to finance blogs).
